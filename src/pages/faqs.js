          <p>
            Virtual credit cards provide several convenience and security
            advantages and are digital versions of your physical credit card.
            The 16-digit number, CVC, expiration date, and PIN code are all
            included, just like on a physical card.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to physical cards, a virtual card is linked to an active
            credit card account; therefore, it is immediately usable by
            customers when a random 16-digit number is generated and assigned.
