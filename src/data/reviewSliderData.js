    title: 'Great Card, Great Service',
    review: `I got this card a little over a month ago to help rebuild my credit. Their security deposit is easy to hand in and you can do it in pieces, ex: $100 a week until all paid up. After my security deposit was paid, the card came quickly. Activation was easy and it has been easy to use. Payments are also easy to make if you are using online banking. All in all very satisfied with the service I have received thus far.`,

                    system is super easy to navigate. It's helping me build up my credit after a few years of bad

    review: `I was calling about my points. I had an issue about why my points are still not uploading to my
                    account. And I was told that it will take some time for the IT team to review it. Also, I ordered
                    another plastk Credit card. Due to my current one is chipping away slowly. The representative was
                    very helpful and punctual. Thank you`,

    title: 'Customer service is excellent!!',
    review: `I spoke with Natalie for a while and she was so patient and helpful even though I felt silly with
                    all the questions I had to ask. I feel better and I understand my credit better after speaking with
                    MO. at 6 am his time. His courteous attitude was so refreshing although he is not generally a
                    customer service representative. He explained my credit files and best practices for maintaining
                    good credit. I’m super grateful and I will continue to be a stellar customer until my credit is back
                    to where it should be before my life turned upside down. Thank you for caring. #loyalcustomerforever`,

    review: `So far I have seen mixed reviews but my personal experience so far has been great. All my
                    communication has been either through live chat or by email and it has always been prompt. Changing
                    my address was a breeze. The times I called I couldn&apos;t get through but all the newer companies
                    are going towards the all-digital online trend anyways. And like I said that part was always prompt
                    and helpful.`,

    title: 'Plastk is the best-secured card in Canada',
    review: `The Plastk secured credit card is the best way in Canada to increase your credit score quickly. The
                    mobile app is amazing and comes partnered with a real-time Equifax credit report. Plastk also has a
                    rewards store to redeem points you earn from everyday purchases. Highly recommend this card to
                    anyone looking to increase their credit score.`,

    title: 'In terms of a secured credit card',
    review: `In terms of a secured credit card, it’s been great! The application process is easy and
                    straightforward (a big plus), and I believe is the only secured card, or “less than ideal credit”
                    card that actually offers SOMETHING for using it! This is nice for people whose situations are what
                    they are BUT ARE NOT treated poorly for it. The app is great, and everything is displayed nicely
                    while making a payment is equally a breeze. Overall happy I found this card, and hopefully, this
                    long-winded review will help someone else who was on the fence like me.`,

                    and handled whatever was of concern to me. I am staying put with them, I recommend them to any
